# Simple-Stopwatch-and-Timer
This project implements a stopwatch and timer in c++ using the cross-platform qt framework

First form: Stopwatch. 
The real time is displayed at the top. When you click on the "Start" button, the stopwatch will come into operation, it can be stopped by "Stop", continue working by pressing the "Continue" button or reset by "Reset". (Note the Screens folder and the Stopwatch.png file)

Second form: Timer. 
Before pressing the "Start" button, you need to set the timer operation time. The timer can also be paused "Pause", continue the timer "Continue" or reset everything to the initial settings "Cancel". When the timer expires, the Qmessagebox window appears, which signals the end of the timer. (Note the Screens folder and the Timer.png file)
